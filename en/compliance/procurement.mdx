As a recruiting partner, our perspective is focused on sustainable collaboration at eye level. In addition to the legitimate interest of every procurement department to achieve the best possible terms, our focus in coordination is to tailor the framework conditions of the collaboration so that they ideally fit the individual circumstances of your company. You can be sure that we will find the right arrangement for every situation—whether it concerns (internal) billing, payment modalities, or pricing.
