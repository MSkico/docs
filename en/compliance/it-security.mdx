### 2. Integrity

The integrity of all processed data is ensured by consistent end-to-end encryption during transmission. **Communication and data transfer take place exclusively via encrypted channels (at least TLS 1.2 with Perfect Forward Secrecy).**

### 3. Availability & Resilience

Our systems are designed for maximum fail-safety. A central element is our **daily, automated backup and recovery concept**, which ensures rapid system restoration even in the event of a disaster – including geo-redundant backup via Microsoft Azure.
