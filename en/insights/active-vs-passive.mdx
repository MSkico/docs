description: "Effective recruiting needs both."

In recruiting, a fundamental distinction is made between **active** and **passive** candidates. Active candidates are people who are actively looking for a job: They maintain their profiles on job platforms, search job boards, and actively apply for advertised positions. Passive candidates, on the other hand, are **not actively looking for a job** – they are often in ongoing employment relationships, generally open to new offers, but do not apply for job postings on their own.

## How big is the market?

In the German-speaking region, there are around **50 million employed people**. Of these, about **42 million are considered "passive"**, meaning they are not actively searching. The **active market thus makes up only about 16%** of the potentially available professionals.

## Why is the passive market harder to reach?

While active candidates become visible through job boards or career portals, you have to **take action yourself** to reach the passive market. The challenge lies in **identifying suitable individuals, targeting them specifically, and convincing them** – a process that requires know-how, time, and access. At the same time, especially for specialist and management positions, the passive market cannot be ignored.

## What do I lose if I don't address the passive market?

Those who **focus exclusively on the active market** in recruiting accept three key consequences according to studies:

1. **Loss of an average of five qualified applications.** The majority of qualified professionals and executives are not reached at all.
2. **Positions are filled later.** The time-to-hire increases by an average of three weeks per position.
3. **Lower quality of hires.** Highly qualified candidates who are not actively looking for a job are lost. The quality of hire drops by an average of 25%.

## Conclusion: Effective recruiting considers both markets

Efficient, strategic recruiting **takes both active and passive candidates into account from the very beginning**. If you reach both markets in a targeted and structured way, you increase your effectiveness and achieve a sustainable impact on your recruiting KPIs.
