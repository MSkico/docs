## What is a Jobsite? ##

The Jobsite is the central element in addressing candidates. For each position, we create a dedicated Jobsite
that contains the relevant information about the specific job and your company, and is personalized using artificial intelligence.
Embedded in a perfectly coordinated candidate journey with initial message, jobsite, and chatbot, the
Jobsite achieves the highest application rates for you and already takes care of pre-qualifying applicants for you.

## What does the Jobsite offer? ##

The intelligent Jobsites fulfill three central tasks in the active sourcing process:

### 1. Personalization ###

At skillconomy, we think of personalization far beyond just customizing messages. Your applicants
experience a candidate journey that is individually tailored to them at every step. Starting with the
initial contact, through the content visible on the Jobsite, to the structure of the chatbot dialog. At every step,
our experience in designing digital processes and developing artificial intelligence ensures
that the content and the way it is presented adapt to the individual candidate to generate interest and enthusiasm for
your position.

### 2. Enthusiasm ###

In addition to personalization, transparency and simplicity are key for us to building a respectful relationship with
candidates. Professionals and executives from various fields love the way we recruit because the entire
candidate journey is developed and optimized with their needs in mind. Especially top talents expect a
process with minimal barriers, high usability, and maximum transparency regarding the information that determines
whether they enter the application process or not. Our Jobsite delivers all of this for them—tailor-made and with just a few clicks.

### 3. Qualification ###

Our AI knows both the requirements of your position and the profile of the applicant. So that you can present your department with a
meaningful and suitable profile, our AI identifies possible open questions regarding skills and
experience and automatically clarifies them with the applicant. This saves you valuable time and ensures
that applicants from skillconomy meet your requirements.
