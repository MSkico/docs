At skillconomy, you get more than just technology – you get real recruiting expertise at your side.
From the very first kick-off, a dedicated **Success Manager** will accompany you, someone who knows your goals, understands your processes,
and supports you through every phase of our collaboration.

Our Success Managers bring years of experience in recruiting specialists and executives.
They know what matters in the passive candidate market – and use this knowledge strategically
to make your sourcing measurably more successful.

### How your Success Manager supports you ###

Your Success Manager continuously keeps an eye on all your positions and ensures that every lever is adjusted
so that you reach exactly the passive candidates you need. Whether it's fine-tuning your job profiles,
matching with market potential, or communicating with your department:
You always have a competent contact person who stays on top of things.

### Support tailored to your needs ###

Monthly alignment meeting? Or would you prefer a short email? Close personal support? Or only when specifically needed?
Our support is tailored to your preferences. We adapt frequency, channel, and rhythm to suit you.
This way, we are not only seamlessly integrated technically, but also synchronized with your processes in such a way that you
get the greatest added value from it.
