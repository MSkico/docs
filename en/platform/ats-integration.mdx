## Applications directly into the ATS

Our goal is to excite you just as much as your applicants – that's why we're only satisfied when our processes are so seamlessly embedded in your ATS that you can't imagine it ever being any other way. You know your system inside out and shouldn't have to struggle with new interfaces or additional logins. We support all common ATS platforms and automatically push your applicants directly into your frontend, so you can continue working seamlessly and impress your department without any media disruptions.

#### Is ATS integration mandatory? ####

No. Whether you want to start out or even work long-term without integration – with the skillconomy portal, you have full flexibility. If you wish, we can present the applicants to you via our own portal, including all the features you need for management. From feedback with the hiring manager to accepting or rejecting applicants.

## Synchronized with your career page

Whether new positions are created directly in the ATS or on your career page – we fetch the data without your IT needing to do any integration work. Every new vacancy automatically receives an AI-based preliminary analysis, and with just a few clicks, you can release the posting for the sourcing AI. This keeps your processes lean, transparent, and within your familiar environment.
