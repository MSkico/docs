Our sourcing AI represents a disruption in active sourcing and, for the first time, enables fully automated identification 
of suitable candidates for a specific position. This is made possible by our proprietary AI, which has been trained on millions 
of passive profiles in Germany and understands both typical career paths and job requirements in detail.

<Info>Our sourcing AI is not a tool. You have zero effort! For the first time, we free you 100% from the time-consuming 
and tedious sourcing process.</Info>

### How does the sourcing work? ###

Our AI reduces sourcing across different channels to just one click for you and 
takes care of two central tasks:

#### Analysis of your position ####

We synchronize with your career page and analyze in real time how large the passive candidate market is for your position. 
Our artificial intelligence understands the requirements of your position and matches them with the profiles in the market that would be 
a suitable match for your search.

#### Multi-Channel Sourcing ####

Once you give us your approval with a single click, the sourcing of candidates begins. What used to take several hours of work per 
position, the AI now accomplishes in just a few milliseconds. Out of more than 20 million passive profiles, it finds exactly those who 
meet your requirements and, based on their career path, are most likely to be open to a change. The sourcing AI
has access to all relevant sources for specialist and management positions in Germany (more on this under "Multi-Channel Access").

### What features does the AI understand? ###

Previous AI models for recruiting either work with common language models (e.g., GPT) or were trained purely on a skill basis. 
Our AI is based on a novel approach that combines career path analysis with skill matching. Over 
hundreds of hours of training, the AI has learned not only to understand skills and experience, but also to interpret requirements and career paths that are specific to individuals, industries, 
and companies. By including factors that go beyond seniority, skills, and salary expectations, our sourcing AI can consider candidates who 
would otherwise have been overlooked.

### Frequently Asked Questions ###

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Who contacts the candidates?">
    The outreach is done either through your own accounts or—within the full-service offering—by our recruiters and our accounts. In this case, you do not have to worry about your own accounts or the 
    tedious communication with candidates.

  <Accordion title="Do I need my own accounts?">
    No. We handle all processes and costs for access to sourcing channels such as LinkedIn, XING, etc. Only if you want the outreach to be done via your own accounts, we will hand over the best candidates for your position so you can contact them through your own accounts.
